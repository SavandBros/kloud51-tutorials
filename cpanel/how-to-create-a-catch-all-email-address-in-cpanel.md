# How to create a catch-all email address in cPanel

What's catch-all: The default email address will 'catch' any mail that is sent to an invalid email address for your domain, in many scenarios this email doesn't exists.

It means you wanna get all the email addresses sent to your domain and forward that to another email address.

Let's see how we can do it, please follow the below steps to get it done:

1. Log in your cPanel account. 
2. Navigate to Mail section > Default Address menu: 

![]()

3.On the new page choose domain name from drop-down menu, check option Forward to email address and enter email address to which emails will be forwarded: 

![]()

4. Click on Change to save change. 

That's how you do it <3
